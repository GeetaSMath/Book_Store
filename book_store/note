#VIEW SET API
API---application programming interface
example--online shopping
function-based views.
class-based views.
mixins.
generic view classes.
viewsets.
---- FBVs are useful for simple use cases where the view logic can be easily defined within a single function.
----- offer a higher level of abstraction and organization over FBVs, making them ideal for complex use cases
---Mixins are reusable components that can be added to CBVs to extend their functionality.
They are small classes that provide specific functionality, such as pagination or filtering
----eneric view classes are a set of pre-built CBVs provided by Django that implement common functionality,
such as list and detail views.

---FUNCTION BASED EXAMPLE
                        from django.http import HttpResponse

                        def hello_world(request):
                            return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
---CLASS BASED EXAMPLE
                        from django.views import View
                        from django.http import HttpResponse

                        class HelloWorldView(View):
                            def get(self, request):
                                return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
---MIXIN BASED EXAMPLE
                        from django.views.generic import ListView

                        class ProtectedListView(LoginRequiredMixin, ListView):
                            model = MyModel
                            template_name = "my_template.html"
---GENERIC BASED EXAMPLE
from django.views.generic import ListView, DetailView
from .models import MyModel

                        class MyModelListView(ListView):
                            model = MyModel
                            template_name = "my_template.html"

                        class MyModelDetailView(DetailView):
                            model = MyModel
                            template_name = "my_template.html"
